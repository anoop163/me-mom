        How true it is that a healthy child needs a healthy Mom.  A child cannot be healthy or happy absent the presence of a healthy and happy mother.

        Mothers play a fundamental role in the health as well as the quality of life of their children, which is why it is so important to give focus to maternal health during pregnancy.

        Most pregnant women give their focus to the development and health of their unborn child. However, it is important for expecting mothers to have regular prenatal visits not only to ensure the health of their child, but their own health as well both during and after pregnancy.
